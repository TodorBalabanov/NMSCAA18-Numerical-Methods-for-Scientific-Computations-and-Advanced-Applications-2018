\begin{abstract}

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are widely used in the last few decades. They have application in many different areas as financial forecasting \cite{atanasova01,balabanov04,tomov01}, board and puzzle games \cite{balabanov01,balabanov03,keremedchiev01}, image processing, object classification \cite{atanasova02}, computer networks \cite{tashev01,tashev02} and many others. The most popular ANNs are represented as directed weighted graph in which signals are traveling from the input to the output. Each node (neuron) in these models have an activation function according which the node signal is emitted. The most popular activation functions are the sigmoid function and the hyperbolic tangent function \cite{zankinski01,balabanov02}. In this study evolutionary algorithms are employed in order to search for activation function alternatives. The function itself is represented as mathematical expression as the used in the genetic programming (GP).

\section{Introduction}

The main purpose of neuron's the activation function is to limit the strength of the emitted signal. The most common way of input signal collection is by sum of the signals multiplied by weight of the connections (Eq. \ref{equation01}).

\begin{equation}
\label{equation01}
y_{j} = \sum_{i=1}^{} x_{i}*w_{ij}
\end{equation}

Collecting the signals in such way is very dependant of the size in the previous layer of neurons. Also the values of the weights varietes a lot and the result of the Eq. \ref{equation01} can reach highg negative or positive values. Both problems are solved with normalization by usage of a neuron activation function. 

\begin{equation}
\label{equation02}
z_{j} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-y_{j}}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{equation03}
z_{j} = \frac{e^{2y_{j}}-1}{e^{2y_{j}}+1}
\end{equation}

The most used functions are the sigmoid function (Eq. \ref{equation02}) and the hyperbolic tangent function (Eq. \ref{equation03}). List of less common used activation functions can be found at \cite{wikipedia01}.

\section{Activation Function Optimization}

The idea used in Radial Basis Function (RBF) ANNs for parameters optimization with Genetic Algorithms (GAs) \cite{awad01} can be extended to optimization of the activation function itself. The goal in such optimization is to find activation function expression which will reduce ANN training time without lost of ANN operation accuracy. Implementing ANN solutions with the Encog Machine Learning Framework allows usage of alternative activation functions \cite{zankinski01}. The expression of the alternative activation function can be easily represented with mXparser math expression library. The expression is stored and evaluated as text string. Activation function expressions as strings perfectly fit to the concept of the GP. Each string is represented as string chromosome and Apache Genetic Algorithms Framework is used for the chromosome evaluations. Initial GA population consists of valid randomly generated mathematical expressions. Single cut crossover is used and the random cut point is always on mathematical operator. As mutation random replacement with randomly selected mathematical operator is used. For fitness evaluate each expression is loaded in ANN neurons and total ANN efficiency is calculated. The total error for the neural network is used as fitness value. 

\section{Conclusions}

Investigations in the direction of searching for alternative activation functions can achieve interesting results, which may change the way in which ANNs are used. As further research it can be interesting the experiments with activation function to proceed in combination with permutational algorithms as it was described in \cite{zankinski02}.
